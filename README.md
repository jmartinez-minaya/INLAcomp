
INLAcomp
------------

The goal of **INLAcomp** is to analyze compositional data with Logistic Normal distribution regression with Dirichlet residuals (LNDM) using the integrated nested Laplace approximation
via the [R-INLA package](https://www.r-inla.org/). Method is in [Martinez-Minaya and Rue, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13928).

- The code for the paper is available in the [vignette](https://github.com/jmartinez-minaya/INLAcomp/blob/main/vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd). The generated html is available [here](https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/supplementary/INLAComp/my-vignette.html)
